# ✨ Hey Universe, I'm Shreya! ✨
## 🎭 Picture This:
A tech enthusiast who turns database headaches into high-fives! Currently spreading magic at Georgia State University, where I make systems dance faster and data tell beautiful stories! 
## 🚀 The Fun Stuff I Do:
- Slashed database input time by 50% (because life's too short for slow queries!)
- Made React apps that turn complex data into visual candy
- Boosted system reliability by 30% at Schneider Electric (goodbye, digital hiccups!)
- Orchestrated AWS clouds saving 90% costs (yes, that's not a typo! 🎉)
- Built things that make computers see faces better than I remember names 😅
## 💫 My Secret Sauce:
Think of me as your friendly neighborhood tech wizard who:
- Gets excited about pushing boundaries
- Turns coffee into code (and bugs into features!)
- Makes systems run faster than a caffeinated cheetah
- Geeks out over new tech like kids over candy
- Enjoys making computers do cool things
## 🌟 Current Status:
Actively seeking new adventures where I can sprinkle my magic dust on exciting challenges!
